🔥 TASK 1 (Level Up From Expense Tracker)
🧩 Build: Personal Finance Manager (Upgraded Version)

Not just expense entry.


Add These Features:

1️⃣ add_expense()
2️⃣ delete_expense()
3️⃣ edit_expense()
4️⃣ filter_by_category()
5️⃣ monthly_summary()
6️⃣ show_highest_expense()



New Constraints (Important)

Store each expense with a unique ID
Data must persist in JSON
All operations must update the JSON file correctly
No duplicate logic
No global variables
Clean separation of logic inside the class


Why This Matters for AI

This simulates:

CRUD operations (like APIs)
Data preprocessing logic
Data cleaning workflows
Structured state management
This is real engineering discipline, not toy scripting.
